Car A starts moving with a constant acceleration *a*, while car B starts moving simultaneously with a constant velocity *v*.  Derive an expression for the minimum value of *v* such that car B will eventually overtake car A. Explain your reasoning clearly, showing all steps.",

Essay:\nLet t be the time when car B overtakes car A.\nAt time t, the position of car A (x_A) is (1/2)at²\nAt time t, the position of car B (x_B) is d + vt\nFor car B to overtake car A: x_B = x_A\nd + vt = (1/2)at²\n(1/2)at² - vt - d = 0\nFor car B to overtake car A, there must be a real solution for t. Thus, the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be greater than or equal to zero.\nDiscriminant: (-v)² - 4(1/2)a(-d) >= 0\nv² + 2ad >= 0\nv² >= -2ad\nv >= sqrt(2ad). Since we are only concerned with the magnitude of v, v = sqrt(2ad)\nTherefore, the minimum value of v is sqrt(2ad).",
